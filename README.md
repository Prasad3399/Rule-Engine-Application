# Rule-Engine-Application
This repository contains the implementation of the two assignments described in the PDF. The project focuses on building a Rule Engine using Flask, MongoDB, and JavaScript. The Rule Engine allows creating, storing, combining, and evaluating rules dynamically based on user attributes.
**Features**
Create Rules: Users can create conditional rules dynamically.
Combine Rules: Multiple rules can be combined into a single Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Evaluate Rules: Evaluate the rule using user attributes.
MongoDB Integration: Rules are stored and retrieved from MongoDB.
Frontend: A simple HTML/CSS/JS UI to interact with the backend.
